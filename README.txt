Pensieve


* Statement:
The idea is originally from the Pensieve sink in Harry Potter, where users can store and review their memories. It also has the feature to work as a memory capsule. The user can upload text/audio messages or music/photos/videos, choose whether to lock the memory and how long to lock it for. This app is for individual use.
* Features:
1. Login Page:
This page tells the user to enter their password to log in, in case a third-person usage. If the password matches, it will lead you to the Memory pages
(Memory Map, Unread Memory, and Memory History are three fragment pages, we can use the tabs above to switch them)
1. Memory Map:
In this page, all the memories will show in a map, as the location is where they take down those memories. The memories appear as bubble pins on each location and are clickable for the detailed view.
1. Unread Memory:
Unread are those memories which have to exceed the locking date but the user hasn’t reviewed them yet. These memories will appear like light bubbles hanging down in a horizontally scrollable way. And each light bubble is clickable and will lead you to the Detailed Memory page. Once the unread memory is opened, it will be later on appeared in the Memory History page.
1. Memory History:
The user can review all his or her memory history to recall an exciting or memorable moment and synchronize the feeling again. All locked memory cannot be seen anywhere, as our purpose is to get the user temporarily obliviate some thoughts and after a certain period of time they can recall back.
1. Create a Memory:
A user can choose ways they want to record the moment by snapping a photo, or video, recording themselves using an audio recorder, texting out their thoughts or just randomly scratching on a blank sheet of paper. Therefore in such a case, we need to ask for permission from the user to get the access to their camera, gallery or audio. By submitting the memory, all information will be stored locally on the user’s device using external storage. The user also has to allow us to access their current location, and by submitting, the location will also be marked down which can be later-on showed in the Memory Map.  
1. Detailed Memory:
This page will present one certain memory in a detailed way, as the user’s thoughts audio, and photo or video will be presented in a designed way.
